# CodewarsKata
This repository is filled with 80+ problem solutions (and counting) from codewars.com

<h2>How Its Made</h2>
  <p>
    Every day I solve at least one problem on codewars or on leetcode. My solutions are mostly javascript with a couple of java solutions sprinkled in.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Optimizations</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the solutions here are brute force as I solved for completion unless the problem states otherwise. I try to take a modular approach whenever necessary to keep my code readable.

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
    Completing these challenges I've learned that there can be multiple ways to solve a problem algorithmically. It takes time to really understand whats under hood in terms of time complexity when designing algorithms.
