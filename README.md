# CodewarsKata
This repository is filled with my problem solutions from codewars.com

<h2>How Its Made</h2>
  <p>
    Java and JavaScript, I push at least one code wars or some other project every day.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Optimizations</h2>
  <p>
    I take time to look over my code to see what I can do to make it more readable and concise.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
    Completing these challenges I've learned that there can be multiple ways to solve a problem algorithmically. What matters in your solution is that it is correct and 
    readable by those who wish to view your code.
